I am a PhD student in the [Caltech Computer Vision Lab](http://www.vision.caltech.edu), advised by [Pietro Perona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pietro_Perona). I also collaborate with [Meister Lab](https://meisterlab.caltech.edu). My research focuses on sequential decision making in brains and machines. This involves topics spanning computer vision, machine learning / reinforcement learning, systems neuroscience, and behavior.

Currently, I am working on understanding animal decision making in complex tasks and thinking about applications in model-based reinforcement learning. I believe we build better AI by learning about intelligence from its source. On the application side, I am interested in problems that deal with decision making and planning as well as spatiotemporal data.

Previous to Caltech in my undergrad, I worked with various organizations internationally in public policy, such as the [WHO](https://www.who.int), and theoretical neuroscience, as a [Loran Scholar](https://loranscholar.ca).
