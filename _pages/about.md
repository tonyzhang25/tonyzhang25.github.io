I am a Machine Learning Research Lead at Google X for a project in AI for ethology / ecology. My team works on a range of problems, including sensing, ML for sensing and behavior, and optimal control. We collaborate with leading academic labs.

Formerly, I obtained my PhD from the [Caltech Computer Vision Lab](http://www.vision.caltech.edu), where I was advised by [Pietro Perona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pietro_Perona) and collaborated with [Meister Lab](https://meisterlab.caltech.edu). My research focused on sequential decision making in brains and machines. This involved topics spanning AI and naturalistic behavior, including computer vision, machine learning / reinforcement learning, systems neuroscience, and behavior modeling and prediction.

Previous to Caltech, I worked with various organizations internationally in advancing environmental policy, including the [WHO](https://www.who.int), and theoretical neuroscience, as a [Loran Scholar](https://loranscholar.ca).
