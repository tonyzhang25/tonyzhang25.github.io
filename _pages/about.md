I'm a PhD student in the [Caltech Computer Vision Lab](http://www.vision.caltech.edu), advised by [Pietro Perona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pietro_Perona). I also collaborate with [Markus Meister](http://www.bbe.caltech.edu/people/markus-meister)'s Lab. My research focuses on sequential decision making in brains and machines. This involves topics spanning computer vision, machine learning / reinforcement learning, systems neuroscience, and behavior.

Currently I'm working on biological decision making in complex tasks and model-based deep reinforcement learning for control and planning. I believe we build better AI by learning about  intelligence from its source.
