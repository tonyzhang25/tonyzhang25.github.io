I am a PhD Candidate in the [Caltech Computer Vision Lab](http://www.vision.caltech.edu), advised by [Pietro Perona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pietro_Perona). I also collaborate with [Meister Lab](https://meisterlab.caltech.edu). My research focuses on sequential decision making in brains and machines. This involves topics spanning AI and naturalistic behavior, including computer vision, machine learning / reinforcement learning, systems neuroscience, and behavior modeling and prediction.

Currently, I work on 1) understanding long-horizon decision making using graph-based mazes, 2) explainable ML models of complex behavior, and 3) deep learning for modeling biological organisms from multiple modalities. I believe we build better AI by learning about intelligence from its source. On the applied side, I am interested in problems that deal with spatiotemporal data and decision-making.

Previous to Caltech in my undergrad, I worked with various organizations internationally in advancing public policy, including the [WHO](https://www.who.int), and theoretical neuroscience, as a [Loran Scholar](https://loranscholar.ca).
