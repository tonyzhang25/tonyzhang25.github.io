I'm a PhD student in the Caltech Computer Vision Lab, advised by Pietro Perona. I also collaborate with Markus Meister's Lab. My research is on sequential decision making in brains and machines. This involves topics spanning computer vision, machine learning / reinforcement learning, systems neuroscience, and behavior.

Currently I'm working on biological decision making in complex tasks and model-based deep reinforcement learning for control and planning. I believe we build better AI by learning about  intelligence from its source.
