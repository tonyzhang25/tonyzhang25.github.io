I'm a PhD student in the [Caltech Computer Vision Lab](http://www.vision.caltech.edu), advised by [Pietro Perona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pietro_Perona). I also collaborate with [Meister Lab](https://meisterlab.caltech.edu). My research focuses on sequential decision making in brains and machines. This involves topics spanning computer vision, machine learning / reinforcement learning, systems neuroscience, and behavior.

Currently, I am working on animal decision making in complex tasks and model-based deep reinforcement learning for control and planning. I believe we build better AI by learning about intelligence from its source.
